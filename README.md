# Time recording system Website
The time recording system should be there so that when you work on a project, you can see which employee has worked on a project and for how long.

## Important Information!
This website was made in an internship, but I changed it a bit, because it used libaries from Bootsrap that were stored locally in the project, 
but I never used them.

The website was made in 2021 and is no longer a current project of mine!

This site also doesn't work properly, so it doesn't store the recorded time in a database!

## How to use?
Look into the config.php, enter your data for your database and then open the install.php in your browser.

If everything works, you should get to the login page.

Unfortunately, you have to set Manuel, the user you created, to Administration in the database at the beginning.
